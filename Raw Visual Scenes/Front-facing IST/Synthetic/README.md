This directory contains a costumized dataset for front-facing camera acquisition with real and synthetic visual scenes.

Four synthetic scenes were considered in *Front-facing IST*: *Classroom*, *Mugs*, *Office*, and *Tea*.

Each scene folder contains:

+ 300 Traning images (with spatial resolution of 960x540 pixels)
+ The training poses (one file per training image)
+ The intrinsics for each pose

The training images, poses, and intrinsics are used as input for the NeRF based methods training.
