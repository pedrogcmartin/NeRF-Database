The used terminology of video file names is the following:

[scene name]_reference.mp4

where the scene name can be: drums, ficus, lego, and ship, for the synthetic scenes; or: m60, playground, train, and truck, for the real scenes.

For example, when referring to the lego synthetic scene the video file name is: lego_reference.mp4.
